# Convolutional Deep Neural Network for Image Classification

## AIM

To Develop a convolutional deep neural network for image classification and to verify the response for new images.

## Problem Statement and Dataset

The goal of this project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The Fashion-MNIST dataset contains images of various clothing items (T-shirts, trousers, dresses, shoes, etc.), and the model aims to classify them correctly. The challenge is to achieve high accuracy while maintaining efficiency.

## DESIGN STEPS
STEP 1: Problem Statement

Define the objective of classifying handwritten digits (0-9) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

STEP 2:Dataset Collection

Use the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.

STEP 3: Data Preprocessing

Convert images to tensors, normalize pixel values, and create DataLoaders for batch processing.

STEP 4:Model Architecture

Design a CNN with convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

STEP 5:Model Training

Train the model using a suitable loss function (CrossEntropyLoss) and optimizer (Adam) for multiple epochs.

STEP 6:Model Evaluation

Test the model on unseen data, compute accuracy, and analyze results using a confusion matrix and classification report.

STEP 7: Model Deployment & Visualization

Save the trained model, visualize predictions, and integrate it into an application if needed.

model = CNNClassifier()
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)


```

```python

# Train the Model

    # write your code here
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
      model.train()
      running_loss = 0.0
      for images, labels in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(images)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        running_loss += loss.item()

        print('Name: Priyangha G')
